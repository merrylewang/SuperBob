# SuperBob

Super Bob is a continuous platformer with seven levels back to back to back. Featuring a text-based level maker system that makes it fast and easy to add more levels into the game. The protagonist, Bob, can move left and right, along with a normal-sized jump, and an upgradable machine gun to shoot down seeking drones and patroling guards. 

Like all retro games, there are a few built-in secrets and shortcuts for the player to discover. 

The main java code can be found under app/src/main/java/com/example/superbobaretroplatformer. If you would like to add your own levels, follow the example of the already existing levels, such as LevelCave.java, LevelCity.java, etc. The downloadable APK can be found at the root directory under SuperBob.apk

This project was written in Java using the Android Studio IDE.
